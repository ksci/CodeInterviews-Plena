# CodeInterviews-Plena
Plena Data Jr Assessment

To run this program you will just need to execute Plena.py.  It is written in python 3.7 and does not use any external libraries.  I have also included a jupyter notebook.

## Final Questions
The assessment took me a little longer than I had hoped due to some interesting bugs that I discovered when running additional test cases.  My initial time to a solution that passed 80% of my test cases was 1 hour 12 minutes - you can view the test cases in the jupyter notebook.  It took an additional 30 minutes to discover a final issue with the way I was implementing sorting.

I am available to start as soon as needed.  I am a masters student at UVU taking night classes with a year to go.

I have been living in Provo for the last 13 years so working in Orem is no problem
