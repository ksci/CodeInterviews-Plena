# CodeInterviews-Plena
Plena Data Jr Assessment

## Function
Prints the first letter that is not repeated in a string and then prints the string in the order of letter occurances and letter appearance.  The first letter that is not repeated means the first occurring letter that does not appear anywhere else in the string.  This may be an empty character.

## Run
To run this program you will just need to execute Plena.py.  It is written in python 3.7 and does not use any external libraries.  I have also included a jupyter notebook.

## Final Questions
The assessment took me a little longer than I had hoped due to some interesting bugs that I discovered when running additional test cases.  My initial time to a solution that passed 80% of my test cases was 1 hour 12 minutes - you can view the test cases in the jupyter notebook.  It took an additional 30 minutes to discover a final issue with the way I was implementing sorting.

I am available to start as soon as needed.  I am a masters student at UVU taking night classes with a year to go.

I have been living in Provo for the last 13 years so working in Orem is no problem
